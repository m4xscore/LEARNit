# LEARNit
LEARNit is a game that shows the history of old museum pieces. It seems that there is nothing interesting in them, but after all, each subject has its own story. Almost nobody thinks about it. Even an ordinary pen has a lot of history: about its production, transportation, sale, and so on. But museum exhibits have much more such stories, but no one knows about this
